= The UIT Library

**U**niversal **I**ndexing **T**ree. Implements classes to to provide efficient searching of spatial data. The base class is an `IndexingTree`. It is a generalisation of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree[QuadTree], more accurately called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree[__k__-d tree]. 

It is based on work by Paavo Toivanen found https://dev.solita.fi/2015/08/06/quad-tree.html[here]. 

Contains:

* the `IndexingTree` interface, which represents a __k__-d tree of any dimension.
* a few implementations of the above; some are incomplete. Any help is welcome.
* basic geometric classes needed by `IndexingTree`: __k__-dimensional point, box and sphere, with distance methods.
